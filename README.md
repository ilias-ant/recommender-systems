Implementing various Recommender Systems for [Amazon review data](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) as well as [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/):

- [Content-Based RS](https://github.com/ilias-ant/recommender-systems/blob/main/content-based-RS.ipynb)
- [Collaborative Filtering RS](https://github.com/ilias-ant/recommender-systems/blob/main/collab-filtering-RS.ipynb)
- [Hybrid RS (combining the previous two)](https://github.com/ilias-ant/recommender-systems/blob/main/hybrid-RS.ipynb)
- [Deep-Matrix-Factorization-Based RS](https://github.com/ilias-ant/recommender-systems/blob/main/deep-learning-based-RS.ipynb)
- [Matrix-Factorization-Based RS with Federated Learning setting](https://github.com/ilias-ant/recommender-systems/blob/main/federated-learning-based-RS.ipynb)

This project was part of the course **Recommender Systems** at the MSc in Data Science of AUEB, carried out during the Winter Quarter 2021-22.

## Installation

To enable reproducibility, [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) has been used as a dependency manager.

```shell
python3 -m pip install poetry
```

and then:

```shell
python3 -m poetry install
```

## Reproduction

To run any of the available Jupyter notebooks, you can do so through your browser, after having initialized the Jupyter Notebook server with:

```shell
python3 -m poetry run jupyter notebook
```
